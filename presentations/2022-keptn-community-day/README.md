### Keptn Workshop for beginners

New to Keptn? In this session Andi Grabner will show how to get started with Keptn.
We will start from installing Keptn on Kubernetes, connecting it to your application through Prometheus,
and then go through key Keptn use-cases like progressive delivery and auto-remediation.

### Continuous Reliability with Keptn. How?

As engineers we expect our systems and applications to be reliable.
Reliability at scale does not mean eliminating failure; failure is inevitable.
How can we get ahead of these failures and ensure we do it in a continuous way?
Keptn is one of the ways we can go about this.

- Speaker: Ana Margarita Medina, Lightstep

### What's Happening with Keptn Documentation?

The Keptn documentation is maturing along with the software. 
Learn about the incremental improvements we have made, what we are working on, and how you can get involved if you are interested.

### What’s next for Keptn? Rethinking day 2 operations

Keptn was founded with the intention to remove the need for complex and hard to maintainable pipelines and automation scripts while improving application resilience.
Recent trends in observability, GitOps and continuous deployment allows us to even further simplify day1 and day2 operations with a radically different
and easy approach.

- Speaker: Alois Reitbauer, Dynatrace

### Keptn Lifecycle Controller

There is a new prototype in the works, being developed by the App Lifecycle Working Group.
The goal of this prototype is to introduce a more “cloud-native” approach for pre- and post-deployment, as well as the concept of application health checks.
